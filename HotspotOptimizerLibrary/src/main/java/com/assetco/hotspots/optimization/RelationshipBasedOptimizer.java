//
// From Jamie's reqs:
//   1. If a Partner-level vendor has at least three (3) assets in the result set, that partner's assets shall own the showcase
//   2. If two (2) Partner-level vendors meet the criteria to own the showcase, the first vendor to meet the criteria shall own the showcase
//   3. If a Partner-level has more than five (5) showcase assets, additional assets shall be treated as Top Picks
